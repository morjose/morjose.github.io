<h1>The Worker of Secrets and co</h1>
<h2>The archives of the Deathless and the foes of this world.</h2>
    <p>We, at TWOSAC (the Worker of Secrets and co) will describe, in detail, the lives of the most evil deathless to ever walk the world. We will uncover the sacred and the evil secrets of the deathless, and, I, the Worker of Secrets, will tell you how to KILL them, so we can free our world from their tyranny.</p>
<h3>Deathless Files</h3>
    <h4> Thane, High Lord of the House Ix.</h4>

<p>Thane is the Deathless guardian of the Vault of Tears. He refers to himself as "first blood of the Deathless, high lord of House Ix, and shield of the Great Pact". He and the other three Blood Sentinels must be defeated in order to gain entrance to the Vault of Tears, where I, The Worker of Secrets, was imprisoned for millenia. Thane uses the legendary Gelder swprd as his prime weapon, but uses his shield as his more unconvential means of assault. That is ironic, as I stated earlier that Thane calls himself the "Shield of the Great Pact".</p>
<h4>The Collector.</h4>

    <p>The Collector is the most skilled Deathless swordsmaster after your's truly and Ryth. He lurks in his fortress in the Crevasse, an ancient Deathless stronghold, and collects rare and exotic weaponry. If any mortal is foolish enough to find him, he will compliment your weapon, and challenge you to fight for it. if you do best him, a truly incredible feat, he will give you one of his weapons, be it the Orci, the Balak or the Spear of Teth. However, if he bests you, he takes your weapon. The armour that The Collector wears is unknown, even to me, so no matter how much you want it, you'll never get it. </p>
<h4>Lelindre, High Lord of the House Kor.</h4>

    <p>Lelindre is unlike any other Deathless. Out of all my creations, she has the quickest reflexes, and the greatest skill with ranged weapons. As High Lord of House Kor, she is in command of Kuero, the Deathless king, and the Kuero Shino, the most feared bodyguards in the land. She sometimes goes under the alias "The Mistress of The End". Her favoured weapon is The Hunter. Lelindre is truly a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<h4>Ryth</h4>

    <p>Ryth. The merciless and intimidating master swordsman. With skill second only to myself, and perhaps Ausar The Vile as well.s </p>
