    <h2>The archives of the Deathless and the foes of this world.</h2>
    <p>We, at TWOSAC (the Worker of Secrets and co) will describe, in detail, the lives of the most evil deathless to ever walk the world (my creations). We will uncover the sacred and the evil secrets of the deathless, so that we can understand them further, so we can defeat them, so we can free our world from their tyranny.</p>
<h3>Deathless Files</h3>
    <h4> Thane, High Lord of the House Ix.</h4>
    <img src="Thane.jpg" alt="smiley face" height="567" width="600">
<p>Thane is the Deathless guardian of the Vault of Tears. He refers to himself as "first blood of the Deathless, high lord of House Ix, and shield of the Great Pact". He and the other three Blood Sentinels must be defeated in order to gain entrance to the Vault of Tears, where I, The Worker of Secrets, was imprisoned for millenia. Thane uses the legendary Gelder swprd as his prime weapon, but uses his shield as his more unconvential means of assault. That is ironic, as I stated earlier that Thane calls himself the "Shield of the Great Pact".</p>
<h4>The Collector.</h4>
 <img src="The_Collector.jpg" alt="smiley face" height="541" width="591">
    <p>The Collector is the most skilled Deathless swordsmaster after your's truly and Ryth. He lurks in his fortress in the Crevasse, an ancient Deathless stronghold, and collects rare and exotic weaponry. If any mortal is foolish enough to find him, he will compliment your weapon, and challenge you to fight for it. if you do best him, a truly incredible feat, he will give you one of his weapons, be it the Orci, the Balak or the Spear of Teth. However, if he bests you, he takes your weapon. The armour that The Collector wears is unknown, even to me, so no matter how much you want it, you'll never get it. </p>
<h4>Lelindre, High Lord of the House Kor.</h4>
    <img src="Lelindre.png" alt="smiley face" height="640" width="1136">
    <p>Lelindre is unlike any other Deathless. Out of all my creations, she has the quickest reflexes, and the greatest skill with ranged weapons. As High Lord of House Kor, she is in command of Kuero, the Deathless king, and the Kuero Shino, the most feared bodyguards in the land. She sometimes goes under the alias "The Mistress of The End". Her favoured weapon is The Hunter. Lelindre is truly a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<h4>Ryth.</h4>
<img src="Ryth.jpg" alt="smiley face" height="297" width="694">
    <p>Ryth. The merciless and intimidating master swordsman. With skill second only to myself, and perhaps Ausar The Vile and Radriar as well. Ryth is a being of honour and pride, so when he loses he does not react well. In other words, he devotes his being to defeating his bestor. Ryth seems to be one of the only Deathless to embrace technology fully, since he wears advanced armour, flies a spaceship and wields a SolarTrans-X weapon. Ryth is a deadly and dangerous induvidual in total, and I would advise you to, if you come across him, decline his challenge, or you will pay the price of your life.</p>
<h4>Raidriar The God King.</h4> 
<img src="Raidriar%20the%20god%20king.jpg" alt="smiley face" height="480" width="480">
    <p>Raidriar is the most formidable deathless second only to Ausar. Raidriar abides in his castle in the south of the world, having enslaved all of the mortals in the surronding area, he encourages these mortals to think of him as a 'god', thus enhancing his hold over them. Raidriar however, is a being of honour, and makes sure that he can be as fair as he can in combat. Raidriar's right hand man is The Dark Knight, a towering man in black armour, the Dark Knight will guard Raidriar until death. Raidriar was also responsible for 'redeeming' Ausar The Vile, the most evil Deathless to walk the earth.</p>
<h4>Ausar The Vile.</h4>
<img src="Soulless%20Ausar.jpg" alt="smiley face" height="1536" width="2048">
    <p>Speaking of Ausar, here is... Ausar! Ausar is (or was) the most evil Deathless on the face of the earth. He murdered countless beings and burned whole kingdoms that opposed him. Ausar ruled over a massive area of land from his domain, The Tower. Ausar also commanded a masive army that had a reach all over the world. Ausar used intimidation and tyranny to rule over his subjects, and was merciless to those who would try to overthrow him. Ausar was unbeatable, and was the onethat imprisoned me in the Vault of Tears underneath The Tower. When Ausar did that, he also claimed the Infinity Blade, the godkiller sword, which only added to his reputation. However, Ausar was finally beaten by Raidriar on The Plains Of Koroth, and it was with one last bit of trickery that I placed 'The Redeemer' into The Infinity Blade', so when Raidriar stabbed Ausar with it, instead of killing him, the blade made sure that Ausar was reborn into the body of an infant, thus 'redeeming him'.</p>
    <h4>Kuero.</h4>
    <img src="Kuero.jpeg" alt="smiley face" height="300" width="300">
    <p>Kuero, or 'The Silk Assasin', is one of the three Deathless kings inprisoned in Raidriar's fortress. Kuero uses twin swords in combat, and is acrobatic in attacking, and defending. He also has cannibalistic tendencys, being known to eat his victims after dismembering them.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion.</h4>
    <img src="Worker1.jpg" alt="smiley face" height="640" width="1136">
    <p>Now we are at the end of this website, now, I'm sure there you want to learn about many more Deathless, but that's for another website!
